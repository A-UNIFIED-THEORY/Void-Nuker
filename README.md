# Void Nuker!


Void Nuker is a discord server nuker that is disguised as a normal moderation bot.

## Installation

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select New Application, or select an old one if you already tried a bot that said to do this.

4. Your bot should come up, play around with the name and pfp and "General Information" tab. Once done, click "Reset Token", and enter your 2FA code if you have that setup.

5. Copy your token, i have mine blurred out for privacy reasons. Reminder: NEVER give your bots token or your token to ANYONE, if you dont know the code they will run with it.
